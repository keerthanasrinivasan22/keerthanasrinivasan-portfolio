      <h2>Keerthana – Where Curiosity Meets Code</h2>
      <div class="blue-underline"></div>
      <p>
  I’m <strong>Keerthana Srinivasan</strong> — a data-driven thinker and creative problem solver, currently pursuing my Master’s in Data Science at the <strong>University of North Texas</strong>. I’m passionate about building intelligent systems that don’t just analyze the world — they interact with it. From guiding people through immersive <strong>AR/VR applications</strong> to training <strong>machine learning models</strong> that detect patterns in complex, high-dimensional data, I enjoy crafting solutions that live at the intersection of insight, usability, and innovation.
</p>

<p>
  Alongside my graduate studies, I currently work as a <strong>Teaching Assistant</strong> for Software Engineering and AR/VR courses, where I mentor students in hands-on lab work, Unity development, and mixed reality projects using tools like MRTK3, Photon, and Vuforia. I also serve as a <strong>Machine Learning Research Assistant</strong>, contributing to projects such as chatbot systems for accessibility, mental wellness tools powered by EEG data (Emotiv), and generative AI solutions that enhance user experience and system intelligence.
</p>

<p>
  I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from <strong>Anurag University</strong>, India, where I began blending engineering principles with data-driven design. Since then, I’ve built and deployed projects in areas like <strong>fraud detection</strong>, <strong>medical image analysis</strong>, <strong>satellite communication systems</strong>, and <strong>spatial computing</strong> — often leading them from end-to-end with a focus on both accuracy and real-world impact.
</p>

<p>
  I love turning abstract data into actionable insights and blending emerging technologies with human-centered design. With hands-on experience in tools like <strong>Python, TensorFlow, SQL, Tableau, Unity, AWS, Hugging Face, and Streamlit</strong>, I thrive in fast-paced, cross-functional environments where innovation happens at the edge of curiosity and code.
</p>

<p>
  <em>If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that great systems aren’t just built — they’re thoughtfully engineered, line by line, with empathy and intention at the core.</em>

          </h3>
          <span>Vosyn Inc. (Remote) | May 2025 – Present</span>
          <p>
            As a Machine Learning Intern at Vosyn, I work on developing and optimizing AI pipelines for the
            <strong>Cosmos project</strong>, which focuses on multimodal audio intelligence. My contributions involve
            building and refining speech separation models using <strong>Demucs</strong> and <strong>MDX</strong>,
            implementing <strong>Whisper-based transcription and diarization</strong> pipelines, and integrating
            real-time evaluation metrics such as <strong>SIR, SDR, and SI-SDR</strong>. I also enhanced the team’s
            <strong>Comet experiment tracking</strong> by automating CPU/memory profiling and visualization for
            performance benchmarking.
          </p>
          <p>
            A key part of my work involves leveraging <strong>Vertex AI</strong> for deploying and managing
            scalable ML workflows. I designed and tested inference endpoints on Vertex AI and implemented prompt-engineered
            <strong>Gemini API</strong> modules to generate safe, structured outputs for diagnostic summarization.
            I contributed to the end-to-end pipeline that captures raw audio, processes model predictions,
            and compiles comparative evaluation reports automatically in Python and PyTorch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond model development, I’ve collaborated on improving containerization (using <strong>Docker</strong>),
            reproducible training environments, and code modularization for integration with our production API.
            This internship strengthened my skills in <strong>PyTorch, Whisper, Demucs, Comet ML, Vertex AI, and Gemini Pro</strong>,
            while giving me hands-on experience in scaling ML research into production-ready systems.

            <p>
              As a Teaching Assistant, I support two graduate-level courses — Software Engineering and AR/VR Development. My work goes beyond grading assignments; I actively mentor students during hands-on lab sessions, guide them through Unity and MRTK3-based projects, and troubleshoot real-time development issues. Whether it’s reviewing design proposals, helping debug Unity scripts, or introducing students to version control best practices, I serve as a resource for both technical and strategic guidance. I’ve also led mini-workshops and code reviews to help students improve their coding confidence and presentation skills.

          <span>University of North Texas | Jan 2024 – Present</span>
          <p>
            As a Research Assistant, I work across AI, Generative AI, and Spatial Computing to develop real-world tech solutions. I build intelligent chatbot systems using LLMs and prompt engineering, and create immersive AR applications in Unity with tools like MRTK3, Cesium, and Photon to enable interactive spatial experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve contributed to real-time evacuation and navigation systems, supported emergency response modeling, and helped design user-centric applications that improve accessibility and contextual awareness. My work also involves training models on domain-specific datasets, analyzing user behavior data, and collaborating on academic research that explores the social impact of AI-powered tools in real-world environments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I’m expanding my research into neurotechnology by working with Emotiv EEG devices to explore brain-computer interface applications. This includes collecting and analyzing neural signals to understand cognitive states, which can be integrated into adaptive systems that respond to user attention, stress, or mental workload.

          <p>
            At Accenture, I worked on the New Mexico Unified Portal — a Salesforce-based citizen service platform aimed at streamlining public access to state services. I was part of an Agile development team where I contributed to building custom Lightning Web Components (LWCs), Apex classes, and triggers to support complex business logic and dynamic form processing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I collaborated closely with QA, backend, and product teams to ensure modular development and timely sprint delivery. I also supported data model design, implemented validation rules and Flow automations, and resolved bugs in cross-functional handoff environments. This experience gave me real exposure to cloud-native development, enterprise workflows, and scalable architecture within a client-focused delivery model.

          <p>
            During my internship, I focused on web development and backend integration. I built responsive front-end interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also gaining hands-on experience with SQL databases and PHP. I contributed to debugging cross-browser issues and worked with senior developers to integrate REST APIs for live data communication. The internship helped me understand the full software lifecycle — from UI to backend logic — and sharpened my ability to work in agile sprint environments.
